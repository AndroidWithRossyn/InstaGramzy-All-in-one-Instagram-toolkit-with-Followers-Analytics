["When my best friend and I first met, we were both like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re really weird.\\u201d","If I have to clean my house before you come over, then we\\u2019re not real friends.","Best friends don\\u2019t care if your house is clean. They care if you have wine.","Me and my best friend can communicate just with face expressions.","Your vibe attracts your tribe.","We all have that one friend\\u2026","My friends are the most weirdest, most craziest people I know but I love them.","Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another, \\u201cWhat! You Too? I thought I was the only one.\\u201d","Find your tribe. Love them hard.","Friendship is\\u2026being equally annoying.","Every tall girl needs a short best friend.","Friends pick us up when we fall down and if they can\\u2019t, they lie down with us and listen for a while.","Life tasteless without that one annoying friend.","The language of friendship is not words but meanings.","Best friends: they know how crazy you are and still choose to be seen with you in public.","Good friends will share the umbrella. Best friends will steal it and yell: Run loser Run!","A friend in need is a friend to be avoided.","Everyone has that one annoying friend if you don\\u2019t have one then it\\u2019s probably you.","You are my best friend because I wouldn\\u2019t dare be this weird with anyone else."]
